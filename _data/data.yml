    title: Career Profile
    summary: |

      Computer Science engineer with a MSc in Geoinformatics keen on solving complex scientific problems through the spatio-temporal
      analysis of GIS data collections. My professional career has naturally evolved from GIS software developer to data
      scientist. Currently, I have five years of specialization in data analysis and machine learning in the fields of climate
      services research and environmental modelling. In the past I have worked in projects related with weather sensor data,
      smart cities, and food security. I have a broad experience analyzing GIS data and managing crowdsourced data, spatial databases,
      sensor webs, and web services. Having good communication skills and a good understanding of computers and algorithms, makes
      me an effective presenter, capable of conveying complex results to all audiences.
